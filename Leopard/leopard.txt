And here's the written review if you don't wanna watch the video:
Today I'm gonna review Kamiko, a hidden gem on the Nintendo Switch eShop. This is actually one the cheapest games on the console right now and it is also one of the best indie titles released this year on the Nintendo Switch.
The level design and gameplay in Kamiko are clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda series. All the 4 stages of the title work in a similar fashion to the dunegons from the Zelda games: you walk around killing enemies in real time, solving some puzzles, getting keys, opening new areas and so on. Everything is very well designed and all the level are really fun to explore. In addition to that, the game also has some really cool boss battles that are also very similar to the boss fights you would find in a Zelda title.
The controls in Kamiko are very intuitive and the game gives you the option to control 3 different characters with their own weapons and playstyle, and I think that adds some replay value to the game, since after beating Kamiko once, you can start a new adventure with a new character.
The graphics in Kamiko follow a pixelated retro style that works really well here. Everything is very colorful, well animated and overall the visuals come together quite nicely. I can also say the same about the music and the sound effects. The game has kinda of a happy relaxing feel to it, which not a bad thing at all in my opinion. Even the ending of game is cute and heartwarming.
Kamiko is charming little adventure that offers excellent gameplay, nice visuals and a good soundtrack. It's a game that I would recoomend to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch.
